GetVer16 illustrates the compatibility kludge Windows 95 uses
to avoid breaking 16-bit Windows applications that incorrectly
check the version number returned by GetVersion.

This sample is for use with MSVC 1.52 (i.e., the 16-bit version
of Microsoft Visual C++). Copy the project files to your hard
disk and open the GETVER.MAK project inside Visual Workbench to
build and test this sample.
