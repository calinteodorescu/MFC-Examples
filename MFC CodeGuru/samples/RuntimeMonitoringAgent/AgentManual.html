<A NAME="Introduction"></A><FONT COLOR="#000000">Introduction</FONT></H1>
Often while developing an application, programmer needs an information
about a value of specific variable, time needed to execute a piece of code
or just plain info that some function/module has been entered/exited. Most
of these information can be collected using a debugger but, debugger interrupts
normal program execution (critical for communication programs) and doesn't
give any time related info (for example, how long does it take to execute
an SQL statement or what is the time difference between sending a command
and receiving a response from a device connected to a serial port). Also,
once you build a release version, you lose any debugging capabilities unless
they are hard-coded into the program.

<P>Most often, programmers use dump to file as a way to collect info but
it has several limitations. You cannot view info while program is running,
you lose some or all data if program crashes and it's very difficult to
find something in a mass of data collected in this way.

<P>That's were Runtime Monitoring Agent (plain Agent in further text) comes
in !!!
<H2>
The Agent</H2>
Agent is a separate, stand-alone process which uses Win32 inter process
communication facilities to receive programmer defined messages coming
from a client process via an Agent DLL loaded into the client process.
Agent has an Explorer like user interface. One of the requirements for
the Agent is that it can be used with programming environments other then
C++ (for example, Delphi). This is the reason why the Agent is statically
linked with MFC and C++ runtime library (programmer doesn't need anything
else but the Agent itself to run it on a target computer). Agent DLL is
a non-MFC DLL with a very small footprint which is loaded into the client
program address space and implements a communication channel with an Agent.
Besides Visual C++, it can also be used for programming environments like
Delphi. For convenience, there is also a C++ Agent library which takes
care of dynamically loading the Agent DLL. It is also very small and will
enable a process to work even if Agent DLL is not found.

<P>Some terminology is necessary to explain the philosophy behind the Agent.
<H2>
<A NAME="Terminology"></A>Terminology</H2>
Agent monitors a <B>System</B> -- set of executable modules which are part
of a project programmer is working on. Module is either an executable file
or a DLL. Within a System, programmer defines processes. <B>Process</B>
is equivalent to a module (executable or DLL). Process can also be a part
of a module if it is convenient for a programmer (for example, a special
worker thread). Each process contains one or more fibers. <B>Fiber</B>
is related to one function, algorithm or any other piece of code programmer
can think of. Each fiber contains one or more messages. <B>Message</B>
is at the lowest level and contains a user defined text (usually built
with a sprinf or CString in order to contain runtime data) and optionally
a Win32 error code. It can also contain a source code file name and a line
number from which a message is sent. Agent DLL automatically adds a timestamp
when the message is sent.
<H1>
<A NAME="UserInterface"></A>User Interface</H1>
The Agent has an explorer like user interface. Left pane is a tree view
with a list of processes in a system and a list of fibers in each process.
This is automatically filled from the client application. Right pane is
splitted into a fixed dimension title pane which contains the name of the
currently selected system, process or alias and a list view pane which
is automatically filled with messages as they are received (from the client
application). There are several possible operations user can perform via
the user interface.
<UL>
<LI>
User can always save the current session in a file with an extension .agt
for later reference and analysis.</LI>

<LI>
Agent can be hidden from the screen and left on a taskbar as an icon.</LI>
</UL>

<H2>
Tree view (<A HREF="#Terminology">system</A>/<A HREF="#Terminology">processes</A>/<A HREF="#Terminology">fibers</A>)</H2>
At the root of the tree view is a registered system. Its children are registered
processes with the exception of the "All checked fibers" process which
is automatically added by the Agent. Children of each process are its fibers.
Each fiber is implemented as a checkbox - user can select it or deselect
it by clicking on a box on the left of the node label.
<DL>
<DL>
<LI>
If you double click on a tree node, list view will display all messages
corresponding to a selected node. If it is a process, you will get all
the messages corresponding to all the fibers in a selected process. If
it is a system, you will get messages for all the fibers for all the processes
in a system. Special case is a local "All checked fibers" process.</LI>

<LI>
If you click on a checkbox associated with a fiber, you will select/deselect
a fiber. Double click on an "All checked fibers" process will display all
messages corresponding to fibers belonging to all checked processes.</LI>

<LI>
Instead of double clicking, you can select a desired tree node and click
on a "Synchronize" toolbar button.</LI>
</DL>


<P>When you double click on a tree view node or click on a "Synchronize"
toolbar item, label of the currently selected node (can be system name,
process name or fiber name) is automatically displayed in a top-right view
(fixed view). It indicates what you are currently viewing since you can
select some other node without double-clicking on it or performin a synchronization.</DL>

<H2>
List view (<A HREF="#Terminology">messages</A>)</H2>
Depending on a tree view selection, list view contains one or more messages.
Each message contains the following fields (columns):
<UL>
<LI>
Date/time when the message was sent from the client application.</LI>

<LI>
Source code filename (full path) and line number (if defined by the client
application).</LI>

<LI>
Message text.</LI>

<LI>
Win32 numeric error code.</LI>

<LI>
Description of a specific Win32 error code.</LI>
</UL>
From the toolbar (clicking on toolbar buttons), you can do the following
<DL>
<DL>
<LI>
Display a short (only time) or full (full date and time) timestamp.</LI>

<LI>
Display only a source code filename or a full path.</LI>

<LI>
Choose to hide columns containing Win32 error code and its description.</LI>
</DL>
</DL>
Directly in a list view, you can do the following with a selected range
of messages:
<UL>
<LI>
Hide all selected messages.</LI>

<LI>
Leave selected messages and hide all the rest (not selected).</LI>

<LI>
Make all messages visible.</LI>
</UL>
This feature is useful if you have a lot of activity in a selected fiber(s)
and you want to focus your attention to some of the messages.
<H2>
Configuration</H2>
When the Agent is started for the first time, it takes a default configuration.
However, as soon as a user changes something (position on the screen, column
width in a list view etc.), changes are registered in the registry database
under the key:
<UL><B><TT>HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\Software\Codor\Agent</TT></B></UL>
&nbsp;
<H1>
<A NAME="AgentDLL"></A>Agent DLL</H1>
Agent DLL is a <B>non-MFC DLL</B> which should be used by the client process
in order to make a connection with the Agent. Using functions exported
from the Agent DLL, client process can send messages to the Agent. Agent
DLL is very simple and small. Since its purpose is to use Agent from environments
other then Visual C++, it is <B>statically linked with C++ runtime library
</B>so that client application doesn't need anything else but the Agent
DLL to establish a connection with the Agent.

<P>Agent DLL is <B>thread safe</B>. It can be safely used from several
threads within one process. It can also be used from different processes
since access to shared resources is protected. Although it is designed
for Windows NT, it can also be used in Windows 95.

<P>Agent DLL exports only one function -- SendMsg() with the following
signature:

<P><TT><FONT COLOR="#FF0000">int SendMsg(int fiber, int process, int system,
int type, int len, void *data)</FONT></TT>

<P>The purpose of <I>fiber</I>, <I>process </I>and <I>system </I>are described
in <A HREF="#Terminology">above</A>. <I>Type</I> is a predefined constant
which describes the contents of <I>data</I>. <I>Len </I>is a length of
<I>data </I>in bytes and is most often defined as a <TT>sizeof(struct ...)</TT>.
<I>Data </I>is a pointer to user defined data with a predefined structure.

<P>Return code is 0 if the message is delivered to the Agent. Otherwise,
it is 1.

<P>When SendMsg is executed, it will add a timestamp to a message (<TT>::GetLocalTime()</TT>)
and send a message to the Agent. This operation has several possible scenarios:
<UL>
<LI>
If the Agent was running when the client application was started (actually
when the Agent DLL was loaded) and is still running, message is immediatelly
transfered to the Agent and control is returned to the client process.</LI>

<LI>
If the Agent was not running when the client application was started (actually
when the Agent DLL was loaded), the function returns immediatelly with
no time lost. It doesn't matter if the Agent is currently running since
client application missed an opportunity to establish a connection to the
Agent and to define system and all processes and fibers.</LI>

<LI>
If the Agent was running but is not running now, then Agent DLL will wait
for 250 ms for an Agent. If the message could not be delivered in this
time interval, the Agent DLL assumes that the Agent is dead and stops sending
messages. Consecutive calls will not waste time but will return immediatelly.</LI>
</UL>
Following message types are defined:

<BR><TT><FONT COLOR="#FF0000">&nbsp; char Name[MAX_NAME_LENGTH];</FONT></TT>
<BR><TT><FONT COLOR="#FF0000">};</FONT></TT>

<P>In all the structures above, <I>Identifier </I>is a programmer defined
constant. <B>Identifier should not be in a range from 0 to 100 inclusive
- this range is reserved for Agent</B>. Since you will probably use Agent
on various different and unrelated projects - if you find it useful at
all :-) - it is good to make a convention when defining identifiers. <I>Name
</I>is a programmer defined and shuld be a description of an object.

<P>Since Agent DLL exports a function which receives a structure as an
argument, it is very important to set a <B>byte alignment to 1</B> (which
is a byte alignment of an Agent DLL) in your project. Otherwise, you can
have a scrambled data when it comes into a DLL.

<P>In most cases, Agent DLL should be linked into a client project during
runtime. This technique will not prevent client application from running
if an Agent DLL is not present. However, you can also use a compile time
linking to a DLL since it is much easier to implement.
<H1>
<A NAME="AgentLibrary"></A>Agent Library</H1>
In order to simplify the use of <A HREF="#AgentDLL">Agent DLL</A> in Visual
C++ projects, Agent LIB is designed. This is a plain and simple C++ library
which performs several functions:
<UL>
<LI>
It dynamically loads the Agent DLL (during runtime).</LI>

<LI>
It offers a function interface instead of a structure and one function
as it is with the Agent DLL.</LI>
</UL>
Since Agent LIB encapsulates the interface towards the <A HREF="#AgentDLL">Agent
DLL</A>, the programmer doesn't have to concern himself with an Agent DLL
any more. It must exist however, but a software interface is completely
hidden. Following functions are declared in an agentlib.h include file
which should be used in a client application.

<P><B><TT><FONT COLOR="#FF0000">AgentDefineSystem(int systemId, const char

<BR>This function should be the first Agent related function executed from
the client application. It will load an Agent DLL and send a system definition
to the Agent. <I>SystemId </I>is a programmer defined identifier for the
system. Only one system can be defined in one client process. If your application
have several different executables and/or DLLs, then each must define the
same <I>systemId</I>.

<P><B><TT><FONT COLOR="#FF0000">AgentDefineProcess(int systemId, int processId,
const char *name)</FONT></TT></B>
<BR>Following a system definition should be a set of consecutive calls
where each defines a process. <I>ProcessId </I>is a programmer defined
identifier for the process and must be unique - there must not be two different
processes with the same identifier.

<P><B><TT><FONT COLOR="#FF0000">AgentDefineFiber(int processId, int fiberId,

<BR>Following a definition of processes, there should be a set of consecutive

unique fiber identifier.

<P>After definitions, client process can send messages to the Agent using
any of the functions AgentSendTextXX. If Agent DLL is found, it is already
loaded into the client process address space.

<P><B><TT><FONT COLOR="#FF0000">AgentSendText1A(int fiberId, int processId,

<BR>This is a simplification of the previous message. Agent will search
its internal data structures to find a process this fiber belongs to. If
the process is found, message is accepted - otherwise it is dropped.

<P>Simple interface, isn't it?

<P>In order to simplify it further more, programmer can define a set of
macros in his/her project. I'll show it in the following <A HREF="#Example">example</A>.
<H1>
<A NAME="Delphi"></A>Delphi component or class</H1>
Since I'm currently not working on a Delphi project, this task is left
to be done. I'm planning to implement a Delphi component with the functionality
of the Agent LIB. It will dynamically load the DLL and offer the same functionality
as the Agent LIB.
<H1>
<A NAME="VisualBasic"></A>Visual Basic</H1>
I'm not familiar with Visual Basic since I don't think it is a language
of choice for a professional programmer. However, software market and customers
require it (I don't know why). So, if any of you out there are willing
to implement a component for Visual Basic which offers the functionality
of the Agent LIB, we will be more then glad to help in any way. Please,
<A HREF="#AboutUs">contact us</A> about this.
<H1>
<A NAME="Example"></A>Example</H1>
The example bellow&nbsp; is a Visual C++ project which uses an Agent LIB
for communication with the Agent. Full example is contained in a zip file
-- this here is just a relevant part which shows how to use it.

<P>Let's assume that example project consists of one executable (EXE) file
and one DLL. We'll show how to incorporate Agent support in both projects.

<P>In project settings for both projects, you have to include an appropriate
Agent.lib library on a link tab.
<H2>
Executable (EXE)</H2>
Somewhere in your project's include files (the one which is visible in
all source code files) or in a separate include file, declare the following
macros:

<P><TT><FONT COLOR="#FF0000">#define AG_SYSTEM&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
1000</FONT></TT>
<BR><TT><FONT COLOR="#FF0000">#define AG_PROCESS&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
1001</FONT></TT>
<BR><TT><FONT COLOR="#FF0000">#define AG_FIBER1&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
1100</FONT></TT>
<BR><TT><FONT COLOR="#FF0000">#define AG_FIBER2&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
1101</FONT></TT>
<BR><TT><FONT COLOR="#FF0000">#define AG_FIBER3&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
1102</FONT></TT>
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR><TT><FONT COLOR="#FF0000">#define AGENT(x,y,z)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; \</FONT></TT>
<BR><TT><FONT COLOR="#FF0000">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ::AgentSendText2A(x,AG_PROCESS,AG_SYSTEM,__FILE__,__LINE__,y,z)</FONT></TT>

<P>Now that you have defined macros for identifiers and a macro for Agent
LIB function, you are ready for the first of the 2 phases. First, we register
system, processes and fibers with an Agent.

<P>In your applications InitInstance function or in a constructor of your
CWinApp derived class, you execute the following code:

<P><TT><FONT COLOR="#FF0000">::AgentDefineSystem(AG_SYSTEM,"Test application
for Runtime Monitoring Agent");</FONT></TT>
<BR><TT><FONT COLOR="#FF0000">::AgentDefineProcess(AG_SYSTEM,AG_PROCESS,"Sample
executable file");</FONT></TT>
<BR><TT><FONT COLOR="#FF0000">::AgentDefineFiber(AG_PROCESS,AG_FIBER1,"Initialization/termination
events");</FONT></TT>
<BR><TT><FONT COLOR="#FF0000">::AgentDefineFiber(AG_PROCESS,AG_FIBER2,"User
interaction with windows/dialogs");</FONT></TT>
<BR><TT><FONT COLOR="#FF0000">::AgentDefineFiber(AG_PROCESS,AG_FIBER3,"Events
in a background worker thread");</FONT></TT>

<P>This is just a sample so it will have to be modified for a real project
and its functionality. Of course, real project will probably have much
more fibers and even more then one process.

<P>Second phase is the actual sending of the message. There are 3 variations:

<P><TT><FONT COLOR="#FF0000">AGENT(AG_FIBER1,"Sample application started",0);</FONT></TT>
<BR><TT><FONT COLOR="#FF0000">....</FONT></TT>
<BR><TT><FONT COLOR="#FF0000">AGENT(AG_FIBER3,"Background worker thread
created",0);</FONT></TT>
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>or

<P><TT><FONT COLOR="#FF0000">CString str;</FONT></TT>
<BR><TT><FONT COLOR="#FF0000">str.Format(""Button clicked. Edit box contains
[%s]", edit_box_text);</FONT></TT>
<BR><TT><FONT COLOR="#FF0000">AGENT(AG_FIBER2,str,0);</FONT></TT>

<P>or

<P><TT><FONT COLOR="#FF0000">HANDLE handle = ::CreateFile(...);</FONT></TT>
<BR><TT><FONT COLOR="#FF0000">if (handle == INVALID_HANDLE_VALUE)</FONT></TT>
<BR><TT><FONT COLOR="#FF0000">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; AGENT(AG_FIBER1,"::CreateFile()
failed", ::GetLastError());</FONT></TT>

<P>Agent will catch all the messages, display them together with a timestamp
the message is sent from the client process. Error code will be expanded
to a symbolic value.

<P>That's all there is to it !!!
<H2>
Dynamic Link Library (DLL)</H2>
As before, somewhere in your include files, declare the following macros:

<P><TT><FONT COLOR="#FF0000">#define AG_SYSTEM&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
1000</FONT></TT>
<BR><TT><FONT COLOR="#FF0000">#define AG_DLLMODULE&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
1002</FONT></TT>
<BR><TT><FONT COLOR="#FF0000">#define AG_DLLFIBER1&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
1200</FONT></TT>
<BR><TT><FONT COLOR="#FF0000">#define AG_DLLFIBER2&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
1201</FONT></TT>
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR><TT><FONT COLOR="#FF0000">#define AGENT(x,y,z)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; \</FONT></TT>
<BR><TT><FONT COLOR="#FF0000">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ::AgentSendText2A(x,AG_DLLMODULE,AG_SYSTEM,__FILE__,__LINE__,y,z)</FONT></TT>

<P>In your DLLMain function, in the case for DLL_PROCESS_ATTACH, add the
following code:
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR><TT><FONT COLOR="#FF0000">::AgentDefineSystem(AG_SYSTEM,"Test application
for Runtime Monitoring Agent");</FONT></TT>
<BR><TT><FONT COLOR="#FF0000">::AgentDefineProcess(AG_SYSTEM,AG_DLLMODULE,"DLL
for access to the serial port");</FONT></TT>
<BR><TT><FONT COLOR="#FF0000">::AgentDefineFiber(AG_PROCESS,AG_DLLFIBER1,"Low
level serial port functions");</FONT></TT>
<BR><TT><FONT COLOR="#FF0000">::AgentDefineFiber(AG_PROCESS,AG_DLLFIBER2,"Top
level exported functions");</FONT></TT>
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>System identifier and text must be the same since we are working with
one project. Process identifier (AG_DLLMODULE) is different in order to
make a difference (in the Agent) between the executable and DLL messages.

<P>Now, we can use AGENT macro to send messages to the Agent.

<P><TT><FONT COLOR="#FF0000">void GetTemperature(float *CoolingWaterTemp)</FONT></TT>
<BR><TT><FONT COLOR="#FF0000">{</FONT></TT>
<UL><TT><FONT COLOR="#FF0000">AGENT(AG_DLLFIBER2,"Get the current cooling
water temperature in a reactor",0);</FONT></TT>
<BR><TT><FONT COLOR="#FF0000">Device->SendCommand("GiveMeTemperature");</FONT></TT>
<BR><TT><FONT COLOR="#FF0000">AGENT(AG_DLLFIBER1,"Command to get the temperature
sent to the monitoring device",0);</FONT></TT>
<BR><TT><FONT COLOR="#FF0000">if (Device->GetAnswer(CoolingWaterTemp))
{</FONT></TT>
<BR><TT><FONT COLOR="#FF0000">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; AGENT(AG_DLLFIBER1,"Monitoring
device returned the current temperature",0);</FONT></TT>
<BR><TT><FONT COLOR="#FF0000">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; CString str;</FONT></TT>
<BR><TT><FONT COLOR="#FF0000">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; str.Format("Current temperature
is %d degrees Celzius", *CoolingWaterTemp);</FONT></TT>
<BR><TT><FONT COLOR="#FF0000">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; AGENT(AG_DLLFIBER2,str,0);</FONT></TT>
<BR><TT><FONT COLOR="#FF0000">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; return TRUE;</FONT></TT>
<BR><TT><FONT COLOR="#FF0000">}</FONT></TT>
<BR><TT><FONT COLOR="#FF0000">AGENT(AG_DLLFIBER1,"Monitoring device does
not respond or timeout",::GetLastError());</FONT></TT>
<BR><TT><FONT COLOR="#FF0000">return FALSE;</FONT></TT></UL>
<TT><FONT COLOR="#FF0000">}</FONT></TT>
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>Finished!

<P>Now, your application supports the Agent. If you don't install an Agent
DLL on target computer, nothing happens which means that the application
works as if there is no Agent. If you however install the Agent DLL and
start the Agent before the application, you get a lot of info about what
is going on inside your program (behind the user interface).
<H1>
<A NAME="SideEffects"></A>Side effects</H1>
If the Agent DLL is not present, client application runs as if it is designed
with no support for the Agent. The problem is that you have a lot of strings
or CString objects through out the code and they waste memory space. This
problem can be solved if all the messages are actually defined in a resource
only DLL.
<H1>
<A NAME="BackToTheFuture"></A>Back to the future</H1>
We're planning to include a couple of new features in the future.
<UL>
<LI>
Automatic launch of the Agent from within Agent DLL.</LI>

<LI>
Find a message containing line number, (sub)string or error code.</LI>

<LI>
Automatically calculate time difference between two selected messages.</LI>

<LI>
Auto save feature.</LI>

<LI>
Support for multiple systems.</LI>

<LI>
Support for auto refresh messages.</LI>
</UL>

<TD><B>But, first of all, we would like to get some response about this
whole idea. Do you find it useful, are there any bugs, are there any new
ideas, any questions etc. Please, if you have downloaded this system and
read this document, send us a note. If you are lazy, just write "AGENT"
in a mail so that we know how many people have actually found it interesting
enough to download it and read about it.</B></TD>
