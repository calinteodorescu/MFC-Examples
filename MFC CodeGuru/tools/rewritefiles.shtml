<P><STRONG><FONT face=Arial>The Problem</FONT></STRONG></P>
<P>This small commandline utility will solve a problem often 
found when moving Visual C++ projects between computers.</P>
<P>Often I need to take MSVC5 projects with me between 
different computers. But sometimes, when a project has been moved from one 
computer to another, strange thing will happen , when you try to compile it.<BR>When the program has been compiled, and you try to execute 
it&nbsp; - or for some reasons hit that ol' Build-button, the whole project will 
recompile, like every file has been changed. This will happen every time you try 
to compile, even if you do not change a single characte in your sourcefiles.</P>
<P>The problem has something to do with the filedates, that 
are improperly changed in some way.</P>
<P><FONT face=Arial><STRONG>The Solution<BR></STRONG></FONT>I have written a 
small commandline utility, that solves the problem. The only thing this program 
will do is to open all the original files, move them to another folder, and 
rewrite them in their original location.</P>
<P>I have not provided the sourcecode for this project, for 
two reasons: 
<UL>
<LI>The project is not a typical MFC program, eventhough 
    classes and functions from MFC was used. 
<LI>The sourcecode is really messy, and uncommented, and 
    many of the functions are in small utillity files, I have collected for 
    everyday tasks. </LI></UL>
<P>If, however, anybody should be interested in the 
sourcecode, please mail me, and I will send you a copy.</P>
<P><FONT face=Arial><STRONG>Usage<BR></STRONG></FONT>Rewritefiles.exe is 
extremely easy to use:</P>
<P>Fire up a DOS-Window or a NT-commandline, go to the 
directory with the project giving the problems, and write</P><PRE>Rewritefiles *.* c:\myprojects\project
Rewritefiles *.* c:\myprojects\project\res</PRE>
<P>Assuming, that your project is located in 
c:\myprojects\project, and you have some resource files in the subdirectory 
&quot;res&quot;.</P>
<P>There are some other commandline options, that will be 
shown if you just write RewriteFiles on the commandline, without any 
parameters.</P>
