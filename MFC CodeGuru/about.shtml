<p>There are also a number of people working on translating this site to various languages. The list of people
working on this is still growing, so I'll list their names after a couple of weeks.

<p>The homepage layout was designed by Kirk Stowell and he also created the background and the logo.

<P>This site started out as a solo effort by Zafir Anjum but 
within a week of its creation people started sending in code that they thought
would be useful to other programmers. Initially I was actually hesitant to accept
articles from other people as I thought it would take time away from my own work.


<P>I started this web site because I wanted to write a book (I have now given up on the idea). 
My idea for the book was simple. I wasn't going to try to teach the 
basics or even the advanced topics but instead focus on saving the programmers some
coding time by giving actual code for tasks that often need to be implemented. Since I 
wasn't confident that I would have enough time to complete the book or even that I 
would get a publisher to publish the book, I wanted to share the material so that my
effort wouldn't go waste. 

<P>I am a Microsoft Certified Solution Developer (MFC, OLE, VB & Access). 
The tests were quite easy since I was working with the related technology. 
I am also a Sun Certified Java Programmer. This test required a weekend of preparation and the format of the 
test was much tougher than that of the MS tests. 

<p>The first page was created on the 26th of June, 97 at http://www.dsp.com/zafir. 
The trafic to the site increased beyond the restrictions imposed by the ISP so I had to move it to 
a web hosting service and got my own domain name in the process. Soon the site outgrew that too and
now it is hosted on its own server at a co-location service. The server is a Pentium 166 with 128MB
RAM running Linux and Apache.
