<P>During my current project, I found that I needed more functionality with my
sql calls than CRecordset or CDAORecordset had to offer. These classes wrap
the low-level ODBC API calls and act simular to a CRecordset, but allow me
to execute any SQL statement without having to bind variables,etc.

<P>The main class for doing this is CSQLDirect. CSQLDirect has the following
attributes/functions:

<ul>
<li><b>CSQLDirect::Connect</b> - Connects to a datasource.
<li><b>CSQLDirect::ExecuteSQL</b> - this is the main function that is used for
handling the SQL statement.
<li><b>CSQLDirect::GetCol</b> - Will return a column from a table in the resulting
cursor.
<li><b>CSQLDirect::GetError</b> - Provides detailed error messages in case something
went wrong.
<li><b>CSQLDirect::GetColumnType</b> - Provides information about a cursor's column.
<li><b>CSQLDirect::Fetch</b> - Will properly execute a SQLFetch command with error
handling.
<li><b>CSQLDirect::Close</b> - Closes the connection to the datasource.
</ul>

<P>The other class CSQLColumn is a support class for CSQLDirect. Since
multiple queries to a cursor's column will result in a NULL value being
returned, I found it necessary to keep track of the columns as they are
used. This is stored in a CPtrArray within CSQLDirect and is cleaned up
after each time the cursor is requeried/closed.

<P>An example of using this class to make SQL Calls:

<PRE><TT><FONT COLOR="#990000">
CSQLDirect SQLDirect( "TestData" );

if( SQLDirect.ExecuteSQL( "SELECT * FROM Employee" )==SQL_SUCCESS ) {
	while( SQLDirect.Fetch()==SQL_SUCCESS ) {
		.
		// Do some stuff here
		.
	}
}
</FONT></TT></PRE>

<P>That's it!

<P>The great thing about this class is you no longer have need for a huge
assortment of CRecordset classes for every table/query.

<P>Anyways I hope this can be of help to anyone that uses the site. Don't
hesitate to give me a shout if anyone has any questions/comments.

<P>Thanks for all the help that CodeGuru has given my over the last few months!
