The MemoryVirtualization sample illustrates how to use various VxD
services to virtualize a memory area mapped directly to an I/O device.
This sample isn't a working program, it's just a compilable source
file illustrating the points covered in the text.

To build this sample, prepare your system according to the general
directions in the root directory of this disc. Run "nmake -f myvxd.mak" to
build from a command prompt, or open the MemoryVirtualization project in 
Microsoft Developer Studio and build within that environment.
