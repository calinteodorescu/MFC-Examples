<P>The zip file contains a set of classes that allow the use of many of the new IE4 controls in any C++ program. The code on these classes is based on the VC++ Technology Preview, the only thing needed from the Technology Preview is the commctrl.h file. Included are classes for:

<ul>
<li>ComboBoxEx (like normal combo but includes images and allow indents on items)
<li>DateTime Picker
<li>Month Calendar
<li>List control
<li>ReBar (both ReBar and ReBarCtrl)
<li>ToolBar (both ToolBar and ToolBar control)
<li>Tree control
</ul>

<P>The new classes for the ReBar and the ToolBar also need the new version of CControlBar (also included).

<P>All these classes were built by examinig the old and the new versions and declaring only the differences.

<P>The exceptions are the List and Tree control classes. These were based upon the classes on the DaoView sample. The List control class is virtually identical to the original: it only adds a few methods to make adding and inserting items easier. The Tree control classes include a CTreeNode class that wraps a HTREEITEM and thus makes it much easier to work with Tree controls.
