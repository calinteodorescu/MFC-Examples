The samples for Chapter 7 illustrate various mechanical aspects of
building VxDs using three different tool sets. All the samples can
be built from a command prompt or from Microsoft Developer Studio. 
None of these VxDs does anything.

Asm       -- A VxD written in assembly language.

C-DDK     -- A VxD written in C using headers from the Windows 95 DDK.

C-VtoolsD -- A VxD written in C using headers and libraries from the
             VtoolsD product from Vireo Software, Inc.
