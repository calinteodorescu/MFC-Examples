<h4>Building Dynamic Visual C++ Programs with DHTML</h4>

<p>There are many windows applications that use the power of the
web browser control - Microsoft Money 98, Microsoft Outlook 98 to
name a few. David Stutz discusses this in his article Building
Dynamic Visual Basic programs with DHTML in MSDN News
(March/April 98). His focus was on Visual Basic. A Visual C++
programmmer can also access the power DHTML in his applications.
The sample Student illustrates this. This example is same as the
Ex28b given in Kruglinsky's book except for the fact that I have
used a DHTML form instead of a simple form View. </p>
