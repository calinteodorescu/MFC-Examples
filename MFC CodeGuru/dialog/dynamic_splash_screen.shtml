<h4>Purpose:</h4>

Shows a splash screen with extra features:
<ul>
	<li>Enables dynamic writing of text on the splash-screen
	<li>Enables dynamic displaying bitmaps transparently on the splash-screen
	<li>All text-effects (text, sizes, fonts, positions) can be changed within a timer-procedure
	This allows you to create "animated" splash-screens
	<li>Uses a second thread, useful especially for long startup-time of application
</ul>

<h4>How to use:</h4>

1. You have to create the spash within your CMainFrame::OnCreate().<br>
Then, set bitmap, text and  some other settings (text-positions and how long the splash
should appear) and call CreateThread().<br>
That's all. The thread is destroyed and deleted automatically!

<FONT COLOR="#990000"><TT><PRE>
int CMainFrame::OnCreate(LPCREATESTRUCT lpCreateStruct)
{
	CSplashThread *pThread = new CSplashThread();
	pThread->AddStringHeaderMain("My Application");
	// .. some other settings
	pThread->SetTimerDuration(5000); // 5 seconds
	pThread->CreateThread();


	if (CMDIFrameWnd::OnCreate(lpCreateStruct) == -1)
		return -1;
	// ...
}
</tt></PRE></FONT>

2. If you want extra features, create your own thread-class derived from CSplashThread
(as done in the sample, download-size is 140 kB). Within this sample, the internal timer
is activated. Each timer resets the position of the Header-text and repaints the splash.
This creaes an animated splash-screen.

<h4>How it works:</h4>
* The splash-screen uses the class CSplashThread which is derived from CWinThread. The
splash-Window is created from the internal CSplashThread::InitInstance(). This function
is called when the thread is created with CWinThread::CreateThread().<br>
* In InitInstance() the Splash-Window is created. Then the splash-window redirects some
important messages,  like painting, timer, to the creating CSplashThread-class. This class
handles these messages.<br>
* The thread is destroyed when the "finish-timer arrives" with SetTimerDuration(). It calls
HideSplashScreen()  (you can call this function also directly, like in the sample).
HideSplashScreen() calls DestroyWindow() of the splash-window.<br>
* If you want extras, just derive from the class and override some functions, as shown in the example.

<h4>Remarks:</h4>
* If you have enchancements to the code, mail to mloibl@moss.de<br>
* The sample uses the function DrawTransparentBitmap(). The original code is from Q79212
and  some places also here on www.codeguru.com. It is changed, because the code doesn't 
work with mapping-modes other than MM_TEXT<br>
* There should be no reason for the code not working with unicode<br>
* This code was build with MFC shipped with VC++5.0,  Enterprise Edition, Service Pack 3<br>
