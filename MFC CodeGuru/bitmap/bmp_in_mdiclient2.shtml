<P>This code was contributed by <A HREF="mailto:David_Simpson@cwb.com">David Simpson</A>. 


<P>The zipped up project is an extended version of the code provided
by <b>Neil A. Van Note</b>. I initially used Neil's code, but ran into a problem
initially as the code did not properly handle 256 color bitmap
The CMdiClient code has been changed to load a bitmap from a file or
a resource as a DIB. Many classes have been written that implement
DIBs, however these provide far more functionality than is required here.
Thus reading and loading DIBs is handled directly by the CMdiClient
class, and thus this sample also provides a good example of how to do
this. The code for reading a bitmap from file is lifted directly from
the WinCap sample from MSDN. Most of the DIB handling is done
directly through the SDK calls merely for convenience in this instance.

<P>The sample also implements a property sheet for setting, previewing
and applying the background bitmaps. The options property page allows
the user to assign a background from a selection of resources or to
use an external bitmap file, much in the same way as the Windows
desktop. You also have the option to tile or centre the bitmap.

<P>A property sheet was used here in my own app which has many user option
sheets, but this could easily be implemented in a dialog. All the settings
for the user are preserved in the registry.

<P>In my own implemetation of this, I also have an option to define a
background color as well as the bitmap. The code is included in this sample
but is commented out as the property page uses one of Stingray's Toolkit
controls, the SECColorWell button. You can easilly implement your own
version of this, but I can definitely recommend the Stingray libraries
for any serious users.

<P>This code is far from perfect and any comments are welcome. One thing
I know I haven't bothered doing is providing a preview facility for
external bitmaps, but it should be trivial to do.

<P>As ever your welcome to use this code in any way you like, but neither
I nor the company I work for are liable for nasty things it might
decide to do.
