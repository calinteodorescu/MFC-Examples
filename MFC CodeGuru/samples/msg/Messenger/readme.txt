Hi,

I look to section samples, and find what this section very small. So I decide make big sample with code from codeguru.

In this sample you can find:
1. How solve "long operation problem"? Simples example you find in file AppIdle.cpp
1. You use Recordset? Is little bit tough, so look to file MailMessage.cpp [LoadDAO, SaverDAO].
2. How make splitters in splitter? Look to MainFrm.cpp [OnCreateClient].
3. Need build version? Look to Messenger.cpp [CAbout::OnInitDialog]
4. Use registry, how demands WinLogo? Look to Messenger.cpp  [CMessengerApp::InitInstance]
5. Template window, it is possible? Look to PropDlg.cpp
6. Automatically link with library. Look to file WNetEnum.

What more I find in this sample?
