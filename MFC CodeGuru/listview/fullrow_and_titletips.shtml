This article was contributed by <A HREF="mbells@calum.csclub.uwaterloo.ca">Matthew Bells</A>.

<P>This code is an enhancement to the code by Zafir Anjum and Mark Findlay
which provides full row highlighting and TitleTips enhancements for the
CListCtrl. If  you've noticed in MS-Dev, the TittleTips show
highlighting. This code is an extension which has TitleTips which can
change colors as well as performance enhancements to reduce flickering.

<P>Another useful addition is notifying the parent window of the CListCtrl
when the selection has changed - useful if you want to disable buttons
if options are not available. For an example, look in the control panel
network services (WinNT); the "Properties" buttons will disable if the
selection does not have properties. This is done by sending a
notification to the parent window.

Since there have been many changes, i have attached the full source.
