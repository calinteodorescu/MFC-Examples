This tip was proposed by Sairama Jamalapuram. 


<p>Syntax coloring for user-defined keywords is used for C++ files only.


<p>Here are the steps you need to take to enable syntax coloring for user-defined keywords. The steps
are taken from the online help.

<ol>
<li>In the same directory as msdev.exe, use the Text editor or Windows Notepad to create a text-only 
file named usertype.dat.
<li>Add your keywords to usertype.dat, one keyword per line. Note: The usertype.dat file is read during 
initialization. It cannot be renamed, nor can it be reloaded during an editing session. 
The syntax coloring mechanism checks the usertype.dat file last. Thus, all previously defined color 
settings take precedence over the user-defined keywords.
<li>Save the file as a text-only file, exit, and then restart Visual Studio.
<li>From the Tools menu, choose Options.
<li>Select the Format tab.
<li>In the Colors box, select User Defined Keywords.
<li>Set the font, font size, foreground color, and background color to your preferences. 
<li>Click OK.
<li>Restart DevStudio.
</ol>

<p>This tip requires you to create a text file with
the keywords. This can mean a lot of typing so I created one from the MFC browse file. This is 
a huge file but surprisingly DevStudio doesn't seem to be any slower. I do have 128MB RAM though.
The USERTYPE.DAT file I created contains all the symbols used by MFC including the Windows functions,
Windows constants such as messages and styles, MFC classes and member functions and a whole lot of 
other identifiers I don't even recognize. Feel free to trim down the file if you want.
