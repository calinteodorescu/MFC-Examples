<!-- Text / source code --> 

<p>      
 I think that default look of common CTabCtrl is not cool enough (for the 
year 2000), when control is used with scrolling tabs:</p>
<p><IMG src="oldtab_inline_demo.gif" ></p>
<p> The CLBTabCtrl class uses my CLBSpinButtonCtrl class 
(see <A href="http://www.codeproject.com/miscctrl/lbspin.asp">"Owner drawn spin button control with autodisabling 
arrow buttons"</A> article) and completly draw itself to look like this:</p>
<p><IMG src="lbtab_inline_demo.gif" ></p>
<p>Beside that, my CLBTabCtrl class has "autoraising items" feature. It means, that when mouse is over inactive item, that item is drawn higher then other inactive items and its right border became darker. This feature also persist when tab control is used in stacked mode:</p>

<H3>How to use CLBTabCtrl</H3>
<OL>
    <LI>
    <DIV >Add LBTabCtrl.h and 
    LBTabCtrl.cpp to your project.</DIV>
  <LI>
  <DIV >Create new class derived from CPropertySheet and add it to 
  project.</DIV>
    <LI>
    <DIV >Include LBTabCtrl.h file in the header file of 
    just created CPropertySheet-derived class.</DIV>
    <DIV > <PRE><FONT color=#990000><TT>#include "LBTabCtrl.h"; </TT></FONT></PRE></DIV>
    <DIV ></DIV>
    <LI>
    <DIV >   Add a member variable 
    to that CPropertySheet-derived class. </DIV>
    <DIV > <PRE><FONT color=#990000><TT> CLBTabCtrl m_LBTabCtrl; </TT></FONT></PRE></DIV>
    <LI>
    <DIV > Subclass the common tab control&nbsp;to CLBTabCtrl. 
  The good place to do this - in the virtual member function OnInitDialog() of CPropertySheet-derived 
    class: </DIV>
    <DIV > <PRE><FONT color=#990000><TT>   
BOOL CLBTabDemoPropSheet::OnInitDialog() 
{
	BOOL bResult =CPropertySheet::OnInitDialog(); 
	
	//Subclass default CTabCtrl to CLBTabCtrl
	CTabCtrl *pTab =GetTabControl();
	m_LBTabCtrl.SubclassWindow(pTab-&gt;m_hWnd);

	return bResult;
}
  </TT></FONT></PRE></DIV>
<P >
<DIV > After that yo can use that CPropertySheet-derived class everywhere as usual CPropertySheet. For instance:
<DIV > <PRE><FONT color=#990000><TT>
CLBTabDemoPropSheet sheet("Any Title");
CPropertyPage page1(IDD_PROPPAGE1),page2(IDD_PROPPAGE2),page3(IDD_PROPPAGE3);

sheet.AddPage(&amp;page1);
sheet.AddPage(&amp;page2);
sheet.AddPage(&amp;page3);

// The following line is required if you wish to switch on 
// the scrolling mode,since stacked mode is default 
// for tab controls.
sheet.EnableStackedTabs(FALSE); 

sheet.DoModal();
</TT></FONT></PRE></DIV>
<P><U><STRONG>Note:</STRONG></U> Certainly you also can subclass any tab control, which does not lives within CPropertySheet. 
</P>
</DIV></LI></OL>
<H3>How it works</H3>
<H4 >
<H4 >1. Overview</H4></H4>
<P>
<P > The CLBTabCtrl is owner drawn tab control. To make its job this control handles the following messages:</P>
<DIV >
<UL>
	<LI>WM_MOUSEMOVE
	<LI>WM_MOUSELEAVE
	<LI>TCN_SELCHANGING
	<LI>TCN_SELCHANGE
	<LI>TCM_SETCURSEL
	<LI>WM_HSCROLL
	<LI>WM_PAINT
	<LI>WM_ERASEBKGND
	<LI>WM_KILLFOCUS
	<LI>WM_SETFOCUS
</LI></UL></DIV>
<DIV >It also overrides virtual member functions 
of CTabCtrl:</DIV>
<DIV >
<UL>
    <LI>PreSubclassWindow
    <LI>WindowProc</LI></UL></DIV>
<P >
<U><STRONG>Note:</STRONG></U> There is a possibility to switch off /on the "autoraising items" feature of CLBTabCtrl, using its public member function [bool SetAutoRaising(bool bOn)]. 
</P>

<H4 >2. How autoraising items work</H4>
<DIV >
<DIV>Only handling of WM_MOUSEMOVE and WM_MOUSELEAVE does the trick.</DIV>
When the mouse enters the CLBTabCtrl it receive WM_MOUSEMOVE message and in that moment I use _TrackMouseEvent API to be notified with WM_MOUSELEAVE message, when the mouse leaves tab control.
<DIV>This API,declared in "Commctrl.h", tries to use the window manager's implementation of TrackMouseEvent if it is present(for Win98/NT), otherwise it emulates (for Win95).</DIV>
 </DIV>
<DIV > <PRE><FONT color=#990000><TT> 
TRACKMOUSEEVENT stTRACKMOUSEEVENT;
stTRACKMOUSEEVENT.cbSize = sizeof(stTRACKMOUSEEVENT);
stTRACKMOUSEEVENT.hwndTrack=m_hWnd;
stTRACKMOUSEEVENT.dwFlags=TME_LEAVE;
_TrackMouseEvent(&amp;stTRACKMOUSEEVENT);
</TT></FONT></PRE></DIV>
<P></P>
<DIV >
After that used approach is straightforward:
<UL>
    <LI> In WM_MOUSEMOVE handler I invalidate the item which is under mouse to draw it as raised
     and also invalidate item which was raised before as normal (unraised).
    <LI>In WM_MOUSELEAVE handler I invalidate item which was raised before
     mouse leaved CLBTabCtrl, to draw it as normal (unraised).
    </LI></UL></DIV>

<DIV >
<H4 >3. How CLBSpinButtonCtrl is involved</H4>
<P> CLBSpinButtonCtrl substitutes the common up-down control which used within CTabCtrl
in scrolling mode.
<DIV>It is done in the virtual member function PreSubclassWindow() of CLBTabCtrl.
	There I look for msctls_updown32 control and if it is present, modify its size,
	position and subclass it to CLBSpinButtonCtrl, which have autodisabling	arrow buttons.
	 <PRE><FONT color=#990000><TT> 
	CWnd* pWnd = GetWindow(GW_CHILD);
	while(pWnd)
	{
	 char buf[]="msctls_updown32";
	 intnRet= ::GetClassName(pWnd-&gt;m_hWnd,
	 buf,sizeof(buf)/sizeof(buf[0]));
	 if(nRet&amp;&amp;strcmp(buf,"msctls_updown32"))
	  {
	   pWnd=pWnd-&gt;GetWindow(GW_HWNDNEXT);
	  }
	 else
	  { 
	   //The msctls_updown32 control isfound.
	   //
	   pWnd-&gt;GetWindowRect(&amp;m_rectUpDn);
	   ScreenToClient(&amp;m_rectUpDn);
	   //Update size and position of msctls_updown32 control
	   m_rectUpDn.DeflateRect(3,2);
	   m_rectUpDn.OffsetRect(3,5);
		
	   pWnd-&gt;MoveWindow(&amp;m_rectUpDn); 
	   //Subclass common msctls_updown32 control to
	   //my CLBSpinButtonCtrl, which have autodisabling arrow
	   buttons.m_Spin.SubclassWindow(pWnd-&gt;m_hWnd);
	   pWnd=0;
	 }
	}
</TT></FONT></PRE></DIV>
<P></P>
<H4 >4. Handling of TCN_SELCHANGING and TCN_SELCHANGE messages</H4>
<P>
	These messages are handled as reflected notification messages. After my handlers do the job, the parent window also
	get a chance to handle it.
	<DIV>
	After CLBTabCtrl control (and its parent) handles TCN_SELCHANGING message,  
	the system will  send to it WM_PAINT/WM_ERASEBKGND messages.
	Since at that moment I still don't know which item has become active,
	and can not properly draw items, I have to avoid these 
	WM_PAINT/WM_ERASEBKGND messages to get rid of flickering.
	<DIV></DIV>
	Since up-down control do not receive WM_PAINT/WM_ERASEBKGND messages 
	if it is invisible, so I temporary  set the appropriate visible bits off
    and the control thinks it is visible even though it is not.
	<PRE><FONT color=#990000><TT> 
DWORD dwStyle = ::GetWindowLong(m_hWnd,GWL_STYLE);
if (dwStyle &amp; WS_VISIBLE)
  ::SetWindowLong(m_hWnd, GWL_STYLE, (dwStyle &amp; ~ WS_VISIBLE));//switch off WS_VISIBLE
</TT></FONT></PRE></DIV>
<DIV>
I set visible bits back on in TCN_SELCHANGE handler, 
when it is good time to redraw CLBTabCtrl. 
<P></P>
<H4 >5. Handling of WM_PAINT message </H4>
<P >a.) First of all to get rid of flickering I'm 
drawing to memory DC (dc). So I have to create compatible memory DC and 
select bitmap into it. </P>
    <DIV > <PRE><FONT color=#990000><TT> 	CPaintDC RealDC(this);
	CDC dc;
	CBitmap bmpMem,*pOldMemBmp;
	rctPnt=dcReal.m_ps.rcPaint;
	dc.CreateCompatibleDC(&amp;RealDC);
	bmpMem.CreateCompatibleBitmap(&amp;RealDC,
		rctPaint.Width(),rctPaint.Height());
	pOldMemBmp=dc.SelectObject(&amp;bmpMem);
	
	// Since we are bypassing WM_ERASEBCKGND, by returning TRUE from its 
	//handler - let's do its job here 
	dc.FillSolidRect(&amp;rctPaint,::GetSysColor(COLOR_BTNFACE));
     </TT></FONT> </PRE> </DIV>
 <P >
 b.) After that I check if current repaint has happened due to autoraised item.
 If so, I repaint only raised item.
 <DIV> Otherwise I repaint parts of border of CLBTabCtr which 
 overlapped by update region. After that I draw all inactive items which 
 intersects the update region. And in the last turn the active item is drawn, in case if it
 also intersects the update region.</DIV>
 <DIV>For drawing of items I've used virtual member function DrawItem of CTabCtrl and virtual member
 function DrawItemRect, added to CLBTabCtrl. </DIV>
<P></P><P>
c.) At the final step I copy the resulting 
bitmap from memory DC to the screen, using BitBlt with SRCCOPY ROP.</P></DIV>
