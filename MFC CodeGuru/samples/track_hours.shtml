This sample was contributed by <A HREF="mailto:Eric_Hoagland@onsetcomp.com">Eric Hoagland</A>.


<p>I am including the source for an application written by me that was originally
intended for my own use in keeping track of the time I spend on projects, but
is probably a pretty good sample for your visitors too.  I've re-coded it, and
added source comments and am making it public domain for the purpose of
distribution as a programming example (and whatever else people want to
do with it).

<p>The application was written using MFC 4.2 and Visual C++ 5.0, and demonstrates
several MFC topics:

<ul>
<li>MFC List control
<li>Printing using the MFC CDC object
<li>Dialog main app window
<li>File I/O using MFC CFile and CArchive objects
<li>MFC dialog data exchange
<li>File drag-drop
<li>MFC CPoint/CSize/CRect objects and abstract usage
</ul>

<p>There are probably a few limitations of this application, but like I said, I
wrote it for me, and now it's for everyone.
