The EventHandling sample isn't a working program at all -- it's a compilable
version of the text illustrations of how to use the VtoolsD VGlobalEvent object
with thread-safe cancellation.

To build this sample, install VtoolsD according to its directions. Issue
the command "nmake -f myvxd.mak" from a command prompt. Alternatively, open
the EventHandling project within Microsoft Developer Studio and build within
that environment.
