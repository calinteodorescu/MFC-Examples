<P>The Icmpcom project is a basic ALT template created by the ATL wizard. 
The control acts as an interface to the ICMP.DLL . This DLL is supplied by MS to allow     
PING and TRACERT’s to be run under a dos window.     

<P>The Control can be used by a VB5 app to create a nice list box and series of     
button and edit boxes to provide a user interface to PING and TRACERT.     

<P>ICMP.DLL is impleted via a Thread which is started when the StartPing method is     
called. The thread continues to run till the operation finishes or is canceled via     
a StopPing call. Tracert is implemented automatically when a StartPing request     
is issued and the tracert option in the parmlist is TRUE.     

<P>The Methods should be invoked in the following order. SetPingVariables and RunPing
can be called as a request is needed. When the app terminates be sure to call     
StopPing.</P>

<P>The sample VB and MSVC++ app demonstrates how icmpcom works.     

<P>The VC++ container was a little more work than VB. The Event Sinks     
had to be added by creating a new class in class wizard based from
CcmdTarget. The functions (sink events) had to be added to the     
CPP and H files manually after the class was created. Note the     
BEGIN_DISPATCH_MAP() section in the cpp file.
