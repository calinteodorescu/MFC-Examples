This is a menu/toolbar/dockbar combination which is as close to the VC5/Office style as
I could get.

This code consists of 6 classes:

CMDIMenuFrameWnd
Overrides necessary parts of CMDIFrameWnd, to allow proper hotkey operation of
the menu/toolbar and to replace the CDockBar for the frame.  Fairly trivial
to use - just derive your CMainFrame from this & the menus work automatically.

CNGenericDockBar
The standard CDockBar overlaps the toolbars by a couple of pixels, which is undesirable if
you want a '3d' look as we do.  This is just a simple hack to remove the overlap on our toolbars.

CNMDIClient
A quick hack to handle the change of menu when a document is opened/closed.  If anyone has a better way to do
this I'd be glad to hear it!

CNGenericToolBar
This is based on the code by Roger Onslow, with modifications to allow displaying of text on the
buttons, and accelerator keys.  Basically it's a drop in replacement for CToolBar, with a different
Create function and a new call (SetVisualState) which switches the text/bitmaps on and off.

CNGenericMenu
This is the draggable menu.  It creates a toolbar with text items only and TBSTYLE_DROPDOWN style.
It attempts to emulate the operation of a VC/Office menu as accurately as possible.  When a button
is clicked, the menu creates a window of type CNGenericPopup, which draws the menu.

CNGenericPopup
This draws a standard popup menu, but passes keypresses (left/right arrow mainly) to the owner toolbar.  
At present it doesn't put the icons on the left as in VC5, but this should be trivial to implement.  It
uses a standard CMenu object, walks each menu item and draws it.

To Use:

First:  Make sure you have a recent commctrl.h from MS, otherwise you'll get compilation errors

Derive your CMainFrame from CMDIMenuFrameWnd.
Change your CToolBar definitions to CNGenericToolBar (optional, but it looks nicer).
Change your CToolBar 'Create' calls to 'CreateEx' calls.

The text for the toolbar buttons is an extra 'line' in the stringtable entry for the command ID.
To add text on a button, just add a second '\n' followed by your chosen text:

Open File\nOpen		becomes
Open File\nOpen\n&Open

Optionally, make a call to CToolBar::SetVisualState to show/hide bitmaps and text (you only need to
call this for a single toolbar - it will be propogated to all existing/future toolbars).
