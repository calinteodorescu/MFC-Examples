<P>You can see this effect on some multimedia programs: as you drag mouse over
the button, the button will animate.
The whole thing is in CAniButton class derived from CButton.

<P>Use CAniButton as a normal CButton (Style must be Owner draw)
On Init dialog simply use LoadAVI( AVI_ID ) where AVI_ID is ID of AVI file
loaded in resources.

<P>The button will resize to match the size of AVI animation.
The first frame of animation will be used as a static look.
Be careful when you create your own AVI file. Not everything could be played !

<P>Here is what is written  for Animated control in MSDN:
<P>Animation controls can play only simple AVI clips. Specifically, the clips
to be played by an animation control must meet the following requirements:
<br>-There must be exactly one video stream and it must have at least one frame.
<br>-There can be at most two streams in the file (typically the other stream,
if present, is an audio stream, although the animation control ignores
audio information).
<br>-The clip must either be uncompressed or compressed with RLE8 compression. 
<br>-No palette changes are allowed in the video stream.
