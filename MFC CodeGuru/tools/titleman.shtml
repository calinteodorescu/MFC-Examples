<H4>The <STRONG>InfoViewer Assistant </STRONG>is a free utility that allows you 
to organize and manage the help 'titles' used by the Microsoft Developer 
Studio97 and by the MSDN library.</H4>
<P>There is some information about this utility and a download link below, but 
for detailed information please refer to the InfoViewer Assistant's <A 
href="http://www.malcolmson.com">homepage</A>.</P>
<P>For information about Microsoft's InfoViewer, see the unofficial <A 
href="http://www.malcolmson.com/infoman/InfoViewer.htm">InfoViewer Information 
page</A>.</P>

<H3>Some of the issues it addresses.</H3>
<P>This utility is intended to address some of the concerns about the InfoViewer 
help system. In particular:</P>
<UL>
<LI>When you install the MSDN Library you get two choices: install all titles to 
your hard drive, or install none and access all of them from the CD's (note that 
installing all the titles requires 1.3GB, the figure reported by the installer 
is incorrect).<BR>This is inconvient if you will only be using a single title or 
group of titles, eg. the Knowledge Base (200M) or the Visual C++ documention 
(only 106M including the samples).<BR>
<LI>When you install new titles and indexes, the files that they replace are 
often left on your hard drive, inaccessible and unused.<BR>
<LI>Once you've installed the Library or a product's documentation, there is no 
way to make changes to your installation or to see what is installed and where 
(I frequently see usenet postings that suggest users make changes to their 
registry just to make adjustments to the organization of their InfoViewer 
titles). </LI></UL>

<H3><FONT color=#000000>The Program</FONT></H3>
<P>Please note that the InfoViewer Assistant currently doesn't require any 
support files or changes to your system, so the download is not an 'install' 
program - it is just the application executable itself. The program's ReadMe 
file and an Overview that explains how it works are available from its home page 
(see the link above).</P>
<P><FONT color=#000000><EM>Requirements:</EM></FONT></P>
<P><FONT color=#000000>All that is required is version 5 of the Microsoft 
InfoViewer, which comes as part of the Visual Studio97 products - <STRONG>except 
Visual Basic</STRONG> - and with MSDN CD's since April 97. </FONT></P>
