<!-- Text / source code -->
<p><!-- The 'p' starts a paragraph of normal text -->
A PS (Process Status) program for Windows 95 and Windows NT.  This is a
program to list all the active processes under Windows 95 or Windows NT.
It lists each program's full path name and Process ID.  If you run it
with no command line arguments, it displays the output on the console.
If you supply an argument (regardless of what it is) it displays the
output in a Listbox instead.

<p><!-- The 'p' starts a paragraph of normal text -->
In addition, a simple "kill" command is included.  If you type "kill"
followed by the Process ID shown in the PS display, that process will be
killed (unless it's a 16 bit Windows task, which would require a bit
more work.)  When using KILL, you can use hex, decimal or octal for the
Process ID, following the normal C conventions -- a prefix of "0x"
indicates hex, a prefix of `0' indicates octal, and no prefix indicates
decimal.

Contents:
<BR>
    Full source code.
<BR>
    VC++ 5.0 SP3 project files. (untested with earlier versions)
<BR>
    hand-written makefile for command line builds.


<p><!-- The 'p' starts a paragraph of normal text -->
Installation:
<p><!-- The 'p' starts a paragraph of normal text -->
    Unzip the ps_src.zip into a directory of your choice.  Assuming you
    have VC++ correctly intalled, switch to that directory and type
    nmake.  The executable should come to a bit under 8K.

<p><!-- The 'p' starts a paragraph of normal text -->
    If you use the VC++ project files, you'll probably get a message
    telling you that the project has been moved -- this is normal unless
    you happen to pick exactly the path name to put it in that I used.


<p><!-- The 'p' starts a paragraph of normal text -->
Known bugs:

<p><!-- The 'p' starts a paragraph of normal text -->
1) Under NT, DOS programs are not displayed. (16 bit Windows
   programs are...)

<p><!-- The 'p' starts a paragraph of normal text -->
2) If you attempt to use the PID supplied for a 16 bit Windows program
   under NT to kill the program, killing the program will fail unless
   the kill program takes the special nature of the program into
   account. (You can kill the NTVDM that the Windows program runs under,
   and with sufficient code, you should be able to kill the Windows
   program by itself as well, but I don't know of a kill program that
   does so.)

This code was written by Jerry Coffin.  It is hereby released into the
public domain.  Since the program is free, I provide no guaranty or
warranty of any sort with it.  However, if you report any bugs to
jcoffin@taeus.com, there's a reasonable chance I'll try to fix them when
I get a chance.  Have fun.<BR>
    Later,<BR>

    Jerry.
