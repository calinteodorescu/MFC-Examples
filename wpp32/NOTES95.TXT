Notes on proting Windws++ to Win32/Windows 95

*** I don't know if it works in NT or not. ***

-Eliminated all near/far medium/large model stuff.

-Eliminated all memory allocation stuff -- new/delete is fine.

-Eliminated APPCLASS -- just use class

-Modified WPRect and WPPoint to be derived from RECT and POINT like
 they should have been from the start! I don't know what got into me.

-Replace printer Escape sequences with new functionsl like StartPage,
 SetAbortProc, etc.

-Modified code for changed Win32 messages like WM_COMMAND, EM_GETSEL, etc. I
 don't know if I got all of them

-Eliminated WPEvent functions so now WPWin unpacks the event.

-Changed all "private" access decls to "protected" to make
 customizing easier.

-Both Microsoft and Borland support DLL version now Zortech/Semantec not
 proven, but should probably work.

I'm sure there are several minor bugs due to WORD/int problems and
WM_ messages that have changed slightly. I could only test with the
sample programs, which all seem to work.
