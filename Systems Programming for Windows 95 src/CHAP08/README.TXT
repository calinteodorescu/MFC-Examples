The samples for Chapter 8 illustrate loading and initializing VxDs:

C-DDK            -- A static VxD built with the Windows 95 DDK and
                    Microsoft Visual C++ version 4.0.

DynaLoad-DDK     -- A dynamic VxD built with the Windows 95 DDK and
                    Microsoft Visual C++ version 4.0.

DynaLoad-VtoolsD -- A dynamic VxD built with the VtoolsD product from
                    Vireo Software, Inc.

RealModeInit     -- A static VxD (in assembly language) with a real-mode
                    initialization function. This sample also illustrates
                    calling registry functions from the real-mode
                    initializer.
