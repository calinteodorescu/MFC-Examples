README:

Before running the sample project, create a ODBC data source for 
MS Access database and select the FASTDB.MDB. The Datasource name
is hard coded to FASTDB.

Once you create this FASTDB data source, you should be able to run this
application.

This is a MDI application. It contains two different views - one uses the 
code generated by the ODBCClassGenerator and virtual list view. This is called
Fast View. The other SlowView uses regular CRecordSet derived class and uses 
regular ListView.

The difference on my machine (266 Pentium, NT4.0, 64MB RAM) is around 5 seconds.
This even more for tables with more columns.

Please send me your feedback.

Thanks
