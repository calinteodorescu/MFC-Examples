<BR>This article illustrates how to use the new (v4.72) common control 
feature of custom drawn controls in connection with the list control to create
a grid list control.  This is part of the whole implementation for the grid list control.
This article covers the custom drawing to indicate the cell with focus and 
keyboard navigation to cursor that focused cell.
The other related article, "<A HREF="multiline_edit_subitems.html">Multiline Editable Subitems</A>", 
covers the editing of the subitems.

<P><IMG SRC="gridlist.gif" BORDER=1>
<P>
You can download the full grid list control implementation at the bottom of
the page. Since it uses the newest common control features, you will need
to download the <A HREF="http://www.microsoft.com/msdn/downloads/files/40Comupd.htm">common
control redistributable</A> in order to run the sample. In order to build 
the sample, you will also
need the <A HREF="http://www.microsoft.com/msdn/sdk/bldenv.htm">Platform
SDK build environment</A>.&nbsp; There is also <A HREF="http://www.microsoft.com/msdn/sdk/inetsdk/help/itt/CommCtls/CommCtls.htm#book_cc">documentation</A>
on the new common control features there as well.&nbsp; All you need from
the build environment are the CommCtrl.h and the ComCtl32.lib files. Make
these available to
your VC++ build environment.&nbsp; I did this by backing up my old files
(just in case) and copying these two files into my include and lib directories 
respectively. 
<BR>In this explanation, I call out certain functions from the grid 
list control sample which pertain to this article.
<H4>
Step 1: Derive a class from CListCtrl</H4>
I derived CGridListCtrl from the CListCtrl.
I added a member variable to keep track of the current column
which the user is interacting with. This variable is the column number
of the item also called the column order.&nbsp; Keep in mind that this
may not be the same as the
subitem when dragging the columns and changing their order.
<PRE><TT><FONT COLOR="#990000">// Attributes
public:
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; // The current subitem or column number which is order based.&nbsp;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; int m_CurSubItem;</FONT></TT></PRE>

<H4>
Step 2: Prepare the control for grid usage</H4>
We must be sure that the list control is in report view and that the
edit sublabel is turned off (this is for the editing subitem implementation).  
We also want full row select and to drag and drop columns.
This function should be called by the parent of the grid list control in its
initialize function (i.e. OnInitDialog).  The reason this block of code is not 
in PreCreate is that the exended list view styles must be set after a control 
is created.  
<PRE><TT><FONT COLOR="#990000">BOOL CGridListCtrl::PrepareControl()
    {
    ASSERT( m_hWnd );
    DWORD dwStyle = GetWindowLong(m_hWnd, GWL_STYLE); 
    dwStyle &= ~(LVS_TYPEMASK);
    dwStyle &= ~(LVS_EDITLABELS);
 
    // Make sure we have report view.
    SetWindowLong( m_hWnd, GWL_STYLE, dwStyle | LVS_REPORT );

    // Enable the full row selection and the drag drop of headers.
    DWORD styles = LVS_EX_FULLROWSELECT | LVS_EX_HEADERDRAGDROP ;
    // Use macro since this is new and not in MFC.
    ListView_SetExtendedListViewStyleEx(m_hWnd, styles, styles );
    return TRUE;
    }
</PRE></TT></FONT>

<H4>
Step 2: Enable user navigation</H4>
The user can navigate the focused cell through the
mouse or keyboard.&nbsp; As previously mentioned we keep track of the 
current column number or column order.  The user navigation simply updates
this member variable and invalidates the item.  
<p>For more information on the cell navigation with the mouse see the article, 
"Grid List Control." For keyboard navigation, the user can use the right and 
left arrow to move the cell cursor.  We can do this in the PreTranslateMessage 
override method.  We only handle the messages if the grid list control has the 
focus.  The pretranslated messages may also be for the subitem while it is being 
edited, and we don't want to interfere with its operation.
<p>
MakeColumnVisible is called to make sure that the focused cell is fully exposed
by scrolling as necessary. Its implementation follows.  The Header_OrderToIndex macro
is called to translate the order based m_CurSubItem to an index.
The up and down arrows are already handled sufficiently by the list control itself.
This also includes the nondestructive edit activation via F2.
<p>The value of -1 for m_CurSubItem indicates that there is no current subitem 
focus.

Step 3: Implement custom draw</H4>

Since this new message is not in VC++'s Class Wizard, you will need to add the message map
and definition yourself.  Be sure to add them outside of the Class Wizard fences. If you do not, when 
Class Wizard updates your source file, it will be lost.  The other message maps are included 
to clarify where you would add it yourself.
<PRE><TT><FONT COLOR="#990000">BEGIN_MESSAGE_MAP(CGridListCtrl, CListCtrl)
	//{{AFX_MSG_MAP(CGridListCtrl)
	ON_WM_LBUTTONDOWN()
	ON_WM_HSCROLL()
	ON_WM_VSCROLL()
	//}}AFX_MSG_MAP
	ON_NOTIFY_REFLECT(NM_CUSTOMDRAW, OnCustomDraw)
END_MESSAGE_MAP()
</PRE></TT></FONT>
Further you will also need to add the member function declaration as follows also outside 
the Class Wizard fences:
<PRE><TT><FONT COLOR="#990000">protected:
	//{{AFX_MSG(CGridListCtrl)
	afx_msg void OnLButtonDown(UINT nFlags, CPoint point);
	afx_msg void OnHScroll(UINT nSBCode, UINT nPos, CScrollBar* pScrollBar);
	afx_msg void OnVScroll(UINT nSBCode, UINT nPos, CScrollBar* pScrollBar);
	//}}AFX_MSG
	afx_msg void OnCustomDraw(NMHDR* pNMHDR, LRESULT* pResult);
</PRE></TT></FONT>

Now the fun begins.  We all like to draw, right?
<P>
The new custom control custom draw is a staged process.  The same message 
is sent at different drawing stages of the control.  If you tell it that 
the control can handle the rest of the stages, it will not send any more 
custom drawing messages for that drawing session. The control
will always send the NM_CUSTOMDRAW message just before commencing a drawing session.
If you want to handle the drawing of the control (any of it), the return value 
from this message must indicate it.  In this implementation, we only want to 
override the drawing of the subitem which has the focus.  The rest of the drawing
can be done by the control.
<P>
There are four stages outlined as follows:
<OL>
<LI>The control asks if we want to handle drawing of the control. Respond that we want 
to handle the drawing at the item level. (The response is achieved by the return value.)
<LI>The control responds when it is about to paint a given item. If the item has focus,
respond that we want to handle drawing at the subitem level.  Otherwise, respond that 
the control can draw the whole item.
<LI>The control responds before painting a given subitem which was fowarded from 
stage two. Respond that we want to be notified after painting the subitem.
<LI>The control responds after painting the subitem from stage three. If the subitem
is the focused subitem, do the special drawing, and respond that we handled the 
drawing so the control will not do any more drawing on the subitem.  Otherwise, respond 
that the list control should finish the subitem drawing. (Actually it is probably not
going to do anymore drawing anyway, but it is good form.)
</OL>

You might think that I could have performed the drawing from stage four in stage three.
If I had I would have also had to worry about indentation, state icon drawing, and item/subitem
icon drawing.  This way, I let the list control draw those and I just draw on top of the label
after it is done.
